    <h2>Host a Rideshare Pushpin for your Group</h2>
  </center>
  <p> 
  [small print: To create a new map you must have a Google account or register here when asked.]
  <br />
  <br />
  Your group's name will be part of a URL; consider omitting 
  <br />
  any <strong>spaces</strong> and other unusual characters. 
  <br />
  Enter the (short) name for your group here:
  </p>
  <form method="get" action="/">
    <p>
    <input type="text" name="place" id="placename" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit short group name" />
    </p>
  </form>
Under construction.  
<p>There are a few reasons you may find yourself back here. 
For example you may wish to make a new map but are not an 
official google account owner ("a user") and you did not 
become a user when the offer was made; or you may only 
be trying to access an existing map, but entered the name
of the group inaccurately in the link address (for example,
did you forget the "?")?
