In social groups and in organizations that repeatedly bring people together, there may be opportunities to share rides (carpool), but people in these groups and organizations may not know the travel patterns of others.

People using this free system supply a map pushpin and just a first name in most cases, and later can remove the pushpin, either permanently or just to make a change. All contacts between people are external to this software system, typically face to face.

The purpose of using Google Code Projects is to develop this system on Google AppEngine so that it can be hosted by anyone who has a Google account, whether the users have a Google account, or not.
