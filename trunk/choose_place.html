<p>There are a few reasons you may find yourself back here. 
For example you may wish to make a new map but are not an 
official google account owner ("a user") and you did not 
become a user when the offer was made; or you may only 
be trying to access an existing map, but you entered the name
of the group inaccurately in the link address (for example,
did you forget the "?")?
